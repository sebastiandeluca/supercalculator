# SuperCalculator
------------------
The egotistically named SuperCalculator was created to help me with mathematics-related problems. It has the capacity to perform basic arithmetic, as well as some more advanced stuff as well.

### Features
Here is a list of all the functions that SuperCalculator has as of Version 0.0.2 (10/31/2020)

- Addition


- Subtraction


- Multiplication


- Division


- Square Rooting


- Perform the Quadratic Formula on an equation


- Invert a 2x2 Matrix


- Calculate the determinant of a 3x3 Matrix


- Find the derivative of a function



### Soon-to-come Features
Some ideas I've thought of adding in future versions of the program

- 2x2 Determinant Calculator (Technically, this is already coded, just in the 3x3 determinant calculator function)

- Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

- More compulsive menu.

        - For example, separating the Basic Math and more Advanced Math into different menus to make it easier to read.
        - This is not set in stone-- this feature may not happen.
        

### Known Errors

The current list of known errors... Hopefully this list doesn't get bigger.

- The Quadratic Formula calculator will tell you your input is invalid if your square-root value is negative.

- Dividing with fractions may give you an incorrect answer, due to how computers interpret repeating values.
