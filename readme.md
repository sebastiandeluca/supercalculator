------------------
The egotistically named SuperCalculator was created to help me with mathematics-related problems. It has the capacity to perform basic arithmetic, as well as some more advanced stuff as well.

### Features
Here is a list of all the functions that SuperCalculator has as of Version 0.0.3 (11/03/2020)

- File I/O


- Addition


- Subtraction


- Multiplication


- Division


- Square Rooting


- Perform the Quadratic Formula on an equation


- Invert a 2x2 Matrix


- Calculate the determinant of a 3x3 Matrix


- Find the derivative of a function


- Perform the Pythagorean Theorem on Polynomials


### Soon-to-come Features
Some ideas I've thought of adding in future versions of the program
- Currently, no clue. I'll definitely think of something. Probably a UI, but not entirely sure.
        

### Known Errors

The current list of known errors... Hopefully this list doesn't get bigger.

- The derivative calculator, and multiplication calculator, do not accept fractions.

- Dividing with fractions may give you an incorrect answer, due to how computers interpret repeating values.

- 3x3 Determinant Calculator sometimes concatenates two strings rather than the integer versions of the strings.
